# Tomographic migration velocity model building using depth-migrated common image gathers

## Introduction

<p></p>
Prestack depth migration has been routinely applied to identify potential targets for oil and gas exploration. Accurate knowledge of migration velocity is crucial for producing high-fidelity subsurface images. Tomographic migration velocity model building is designed to reconstruct the velocity model for prestack depth migration. The objective of this project is to estimate the migration velocity model that removes the residual errors of primary reflection events in the depth-migrated common image gathers, and works with prestack depth migration iteratively to achieve the high quality imaging of complex geologic structures.
