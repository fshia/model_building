# Tomographic migration velocity model building using depth-migrated common image gathers

## Introduction

<p></p>
Prestack depth migration has been routinely applied to identify potential targets for oil and gas exploration. Accurate knowledge of migration velocity is crucial for producing high-fidelity subsurface images. Tomographic migration velocity model building is designed to reconstruct the velocity model for prestack depth migration. The objective of this project is to estimate the migration velocity model that removes the residual errors of primary reflection events in the depth-migrated common image gathers, and works with prestack depth migration iteratively to achieve the high quality imaging of complex geologic structures.

## Ray-based velocity model building
The data are offset common image gathers generated by Kirchhoff depth migration. Fr√©chet derivatives are calculated by dynamic ray tracing. A conjugate gradient method with constraints is used to solve the linear least square problem. Examples of dynamic ray tracing and estimation of dip/azimuth using structure tensors are shown below.
